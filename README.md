# epsych

This Matlab toolbox is designed to facilitate behavioral experiments with/without simultaneous electrophysiology using Matlab with Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) hardware and software.

The hardware and software available from TDT is used in many labs for electrophysiology and behavioral experiments.  

This Matlab toolbox (continually in development) aims to provide a useful framework to parameterise and run behavioral/electrophysiology experiments while still being able to leverage the simplicity of writing scripts in Matlab as well as the large number of other Matlab toolboxes that are available.  Custom built macros for creating RPvds (TDT) circuits to run various behavioral paradigms are also included with this toolbox (in the .circuit_macros directory). 

Currently documentation is weak, but a brief introduction can be found in  Intro_to_ElectroPsych_Toolbox.ppt in the main directory.  A few RPvds circuit examples can be found in the .examples directory.

A few labs have contributed to the development of this toolbox.  The UserFiles directory contains some of the work of these labs.  While all files in this toolbox are free to view and use for learning, please contact me (daniel.stolzberg@gmail.com) or the individual creators of the work before using these files for active research projects.

**Requirements**
* Matlab R2012b (recommended)
* Software available for purchase from TDT http://www.tdt.com
	* Behavior experiments (no electrophysiology):	*TDT ActiveX Controls*
	* Electrophysiology experiments:  *TDT OpenEx* and *TDT OpenDeveloper Controls*
