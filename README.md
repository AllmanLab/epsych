# epsych

This Matlab toolbox is designed to facilitate behavioral experiments with/without simultaneous electrophysiology using 
Matlab with Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) hardware and software.

The hardware and software available from TDT is used in many labs for electrophysiology and behavioral experiments.  This Matlab toolbox (constantly in development) aims to provide a useful framework to parameterise and run experiments while still being able to leverage other Matlab toolboxes.

Currently documentation is weak, but a brief introduction can be found in the Intro_to_ElectroPsych_Toolbox in the main directory.

**Requirements**
* Matlab R2012b (recommended)
* Software available for purchase from TDT http://www.tdt.com
	* Behavior experiments (no electrophysiology):	*TDT ActiveX Controls*
	* Electrophysiology experiments:  *TDT OpenEx* and *TDT OpenDeveloper Controls*
